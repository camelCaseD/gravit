## Introduction

Gravit is a design tool for Mac, Windows, Linux, ChromeOS and the Browser made
in the spirit for Freehand and Fireworks. It is completely written in HTML5,
Javascript and CSS3. Gravit consists of the core engine called "Infinity", the
actual Application and the core Module called "Gravit".

We'd like to encourage everyone in getting involved with this project. You can
develop new features or take a ticket and fix it. Or if you're a UX/Designer, you
could help designing new icons or improving the UI. To get started contributing,
read the [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/)

## Quick Start

Install all prerequisites and make sure they're available on your path.

Then run `npm install` to install all nodejs dependencies
